    "text": "3.1 Introduction\nSpecies distribution models work by finding associations between species occurrence or abundance and environmental variables. Using these relationships, it’s possible to predict the distribution in areas that aren’t sampled, provided we know the value of the environmental variables in these areas. Therefore, to proceed with the modeling in the next several chapters, we’ll need a suite of environmental variables to be used as predictors in our models. The particular set of environmental variables that’s most suitable for a given study will depend on the focal species, region, and time period, as well as the availability of data. When species distributions are well defined by the environmental variables, extrapolations to unsurveyed areas will be more accurate. So, it’s worth considering which variables are important for your species and region.\nFortunately, there are an abundance of freely available, satellite-based environmental datasets that are suitable for species distribution modeling. A small subset of possible data sources available globally includes data describing landcover, elevation, topography, surface water, and [intertidal habitat]((https://www.intertidal.app/download). The reader is encourage to search for datasets suitable for their region and species of interest.\nSince there are such a wide range of available environmental datasets, and the distribution mechanisms and formats for each are different and often changing, we will not cover the specifics of how to download and pre-processing satellite-derived data products. Instead, we have downloaded and prepared landcover and elevation datasets and will demonstrate how environmental data can be extracted from these datasets. The prepared data are available in data package."

    "text": "3.2 Landcover\nFor the examples in this book, we’ll use land cover variables derived from the MODIS MCD12Q1 v006 land cover product (Friedl and Sulla-Menashe 2015). This product has global coverage at 500m spatial resolution and annual temporal resolution from 2001-2021. These data are available for several different classification schemes. We’ll use the University of Maryland (UMD) land cover classification, which provides a globally accurate classification of land cover in our experience. This system classifies pixels into one of 16 different land cover classes:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClass\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n0\nWater bodies\nAt least 60% of area is covered by permanent water bodies.\n\n\n1\nEvergreen Needleleaf Forests\nDominated by evergreen conifer trees (canopy >2m).
